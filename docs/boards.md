# Boards

TODO: Rewrite this to reflect features more correctly

Can you imagine a work day without phone calls, countless emails, all those annoyances that hurt your productivity? 
A day where you know exactly what you have to do, when and how? Where you'd have everything you need to get things done, all cleared out of your way? 
A day where you could focus only on what you do the best?

**I bet you dreamed about it :)** and **Rekanban** is here to make your dreams come true.

With **Rekanban** boards you have everything you need to know about your work, project or a daily routine, in one review site.

## Get on the Same Page

Create an item in order to ask a question or raise an issue rather than firing off another email or leaving another lost voicemail. 
Add an item, and let the conversation happen right there. Once the issue is resolved, you can move it to complete. 

## Let it all happen in one place

Instead of having communications spread all over like in emails, voicemails, **let it happen all in one place** and avoid lost emails and forgotten conversations for good. Describe the task as better as you can, upload and attach files needed (if needed) for the task to be successfully completed. Use the comments bellow to communicate progress of a specific task, resolve possible blockages and issues, **all in one place**.

## Get things done
As your businesses grow so will the frustration. With easy drag and drop prioritizing everyone in your team will know what items have greater priority. You can follow tasks and get notifications for the progress, even though that will be done automatically for the tasks you've created or are assigned to. Everyone on the team will know what is going on via **Rekanban** notification system. Getting things done has never been more simple then this :)

Task is too big? No problem, split it up to a smaller sub-tasks. Even better, chain related tasks one to another. Get a bigger picture, split it to a smaller peaces mutually connected, resolve issues one by one and **get things done**.

But I have to manny tasks, I don't know where to look for anymore? Pace of cake :) With **Rekanban** filtering you see what you need to see, nothing more and nothing less. You can assign a label to related tasks and filter them by that too. Move out of your way all the not related tasks by simply filtering them by:

* Description
* Assignee
* Status
* Label

Will I have to repeat the filtering every time I use the board? Of course not. You can save and name your filters by your likening :) We won't stand on your way.
